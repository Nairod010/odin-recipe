    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tomato soup is a classic comfort food that brings together the rich, tangy flavor of ripe tomatoes with a smooth,
        creamy texture. Often simmered with a blend of aromatic herbs like basil and thyme, this soup offers a vibrant
        red hue and a deliciously inviting aroma. The tomatoes, sometimes roasted to enhance their natural sweetness,
        are pureed to perfection, creating a velvety base that is both refreshing and hearty. A touch of cream or a
        swirl of olive oil adds a layer of richness, making each spoonful a balanced symphony of flavors.</p>
    <p>Typically served hot, tomato soup can be enjoyed on its own or accompanied by a variety of side dishes such as a
        crispy grilled cheese sandwich or freshly baked bread. Its versatility allows for numerous variations, including
        the addition of ingredients like garlic, onions, carrots, and celery, which deepen the soup’s flavor profile.
        Garnishes like croutons, fresh basil leaves, or a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese can elevate the presentation and
        taste, transforming a simple dish into a gourmet experience. Whether savored on a chilly day or as a light
        starter, tomato soup remains a timeless favorite that warms both the body and soul.</p>
