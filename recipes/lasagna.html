    <p class="first-para">Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with rich meat or vegetable
        sauce, creamy
        ricotta cheese, mozzarella, and Parmesan, then baked until bubbly and golden.</p>
    <p class="second-para">It is a hearty, comforting meal known for its flavorful, multi-layered texture and delicious
        taste.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">

        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>2 cans (28 ounces each) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cans (6 ounces each) tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley </li>
        <li>32 ounces ricotta cheese </li>
        <li>1 large egg </li>
        <li>2 lasagna noodles (cooked) </li>
        <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced or shredded</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large pot over medium heat, cook the ground beef, Italian sausage, chopped onion, and minced garlic
            until well browned. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Stir in sugar,
            basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 30
            minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with the egg, salt, and parsley. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 4 lasagna noodles
            lengthwise over the meat sauce. Spread one-third of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Top
            with one-third of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce over the mozzarella, and
            sprinkle with 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers two more times, ending with mozzarella and
            Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil to prevent sticking (either spray the foil with cooking spray or make sure it does not
            touch the cheese). Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25
            minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>

        <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for about 15 minutes before serving to let it set and make it easier to cut.
            Enjoy!</li>
