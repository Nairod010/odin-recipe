    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="first-para">
        A cake is a sweet, baked dessert commonly enjoyed during special occasions such as birthdays, weddings, and
        celebrations. It is typically made from a mixture of flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil, and a leavening agent
        like baking powder or baking soda. Cakes come in various flavors, including vanilla, chocolate, red velvet, and
        lemon, and can incorporate fruits, spices, and other flavorings. They are often round or rectangular but can be
        shaped into nearly any form. Layers of cake are separated by rich fillings such as buttercream, ganache, or
        fruit preserves, and the outer surface is usually coated with icing or frosting, which can be smooth or
        intricately decorated.</p>
    <p class="second-para">Beyond traditional cakes, there are cheesecakes, mousse cakes, sponge cakes, and fruitcakes, each with unique
        ingredients and preparation methods. Some cakes are light and airy, like angel food cake, while others are dense
        and rich, like pound cake. Regardless of the type, cakes are a centerpiece of celebration, bringing joy and
        sweetness to any gathering.</p>
